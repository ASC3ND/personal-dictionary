# Personal Dictionary Generator

Generate a dictionary list as a text file using permutations of terms delimited by a comma. Terms are intended to be accumulated during information gathering phase of a penetration test. The more relevant the terms, the higher chance of success.

## Technical Notes

Current code is for proof of concept for further functionality in larger project.

All interactions are through CLI and the code used to generate the dictionary is to be replaced.

Written using Python 3.5 with PyCharm, Atom, and Sublime Text 3.


## Usage

Enter terms delimited by a comma. Currently type checking is not implemented. After script completes a file named dictionary.txt will be generated in the same directory as the script.

## Future Features

Read from files instead of manual entry (allow for both).

Weighting of category significance.

Options regarding length and character restrictions.

Social Media Integration.

## History

This is an alpha release for a project that began on June 18th of 2016
